# dashboard-analytics-metrics

Implement a business dashboard layout with the following:

- Top menubar with placeholder links for breadcrumb navigation 
- Top right user menu component (no need to implement dropdown yet)
- Main content area with basic grid layout
- Placeholder components for:
  - Sales metrics 
  - Revenue metrics
  - Other key business metrics
- Use some dummy data for now

No need to make the data dynamic or interactive at this stage. Just focus on the layout and placeholder components.
